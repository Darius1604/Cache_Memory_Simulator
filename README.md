# 🧠 Cache Memory Simulator

A flexible Cache Memory Simulator written in **Java**. This tool simulates the behavior of CPU cache memory, allowing users to analyze the performance of different cache configurations, mapping techniques, and replacement policies.

## 🚀 Features

* **Configurable Architecture:** Support for variable Cache Size, Block Size, and Associativity.
* **Mapping Strategies:**
    * Direct Mapped
    * Set Associative (N-way)
    * Fully Associative
* **Replacement Policies:**
    * **LRU** (Least Recently Used)
    * **FIFO** (First-In, First-Out)
* **Performance Metrics:** Calculates and displays Hit Rate, Miss Rate, and total execution time.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Language:** Java (JDK 17+)
* **Concepts:** Computer Architecture, Memory Hierarchy, Algorithms.

## 💻 Installation & Usage
